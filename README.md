This repository contains the Python code for the XGB model, designed to predict multi-output, high-dimensional (132 variables), non-stationary time series. The model is tested using the the UCI Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality dataset. It consists of sets of hourly meteorological and air pollution information from 12 nationally controlled air-quality monitoring sites/stations: Aotizhongxin, Changping, Dingling, Dongsi, Guanyuan, Gucheng, Huairou, Nongzhanguan, Shunyi, Tiantan, Wanliu and Wanshouxigong. In each air quality station, meteorological data are matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration. The dataset contains 35,065 instances with multiple variables in each station over four years from March 1st, 2013 to February 28th, 2017.
